Faster planes and cheaper flights
Faster planes and cheaper flights are making it easier than ever before for people to travel. In the most 'developed' societies, visiting exotic places is a sought-after status symbol. The tourism                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   industries of both developed and developing countries have recognized this fact and are learning to take advantage of it.
There are, however, some problems associated with this new industry. Firstly, there is the increasing crime rate. Some local's tourists as an easy prey because, not only are they in unfamiliar territory and therefore less able to take care of themselves, but also they carry visible items of wealth, such as cameras and jewelry which can be disposed of quickly for profit.
Another major problem is health. With greater mobility comes greater danger of spreading contagious diseases around the world. One carrier returning home could easily start an epidemic before their illness was diagnosed. Moreover, the emergence of many diseases which resist antibiotics is causing scientists to be increasingly concerned about this issue.
Also to be considered is the natural environment, which can be seriously threatened by too many visitors. Australia's Great Barrier Reef, for example, is in danger of being destroyed by tourists and  there are plans to restrict visitors to some of the more delicate coral cays.
These are just three of the reasons why any country should be wary of committing itself to an extensive tourism development program.
